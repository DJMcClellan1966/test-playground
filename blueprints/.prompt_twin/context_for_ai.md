## Recent Prompts (Sample)

These are examples of how the user typically phrases requests:

- I want to build something that helps AI agents understand my context better

## Inferred Preferences

Based on patterns:
- Prefers **local-first** approaches (Ollama, SQLite usage)
- Builds **full-stack** applications
- Values **working code over sophisticated architecture**
- Uses **Python** and **.NET** ecosystems
- Interested in **AI/ML integration**

## How to Use This Context

When the user asks for help:
1. Prefer their familiar technologies when suggesting solutions
2. Match their coding style (practical over theoretical)
3. Reference their existing projects when relevant
4. Keep solutions simple and runnable
5. Note their commit style - they tend to add new features incrementally
