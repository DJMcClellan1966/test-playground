# Architecture Decision Record: demo_store

**Date:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

ecommerce demo

## Decision

We will use the following architectural components:

### Basic Authentication

- **Purpose:** Username/password authentication with sessions
- **Cost:** Free (session-based)
- **Performance:** ~1ms latency, 50,000 req/s

### JSON File Storage

- **Purpose:** Simple JSON file-based storage (development/small apps)
- **Cost:** Free (file-based)
- **Performance:** ~5ms latency, 100 req/s

## Cost Analysis

| Tier | Monthly Cost |
|------|-------------|
| Base Infrastructure | $0.00 |
| Usage (100k requests) | $0.00 |
| **Total** | **$0.00/month** |

Classification: **Hobby** tier

## Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput:** 100 req/s
- **Latency (P50):** 6ms
- **Latency (P99):** 18ms
- **Bottleneck:** storage_json
- **Grade:** D

## Consequences

This architecture provides:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable data storage
- Maintainable codebase

Trade-offs accepted:
- Added complexity from multiple components
- Operational overhead for production deployment
