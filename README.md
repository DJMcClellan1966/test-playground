# 🧪 Idea Playground

A collaborative workspace for experimenting with ideas, prototypes, and projects with AI assistance.

## How This Works

This workspace is designed for rapid prototyping and experimentation. You bring the ideas, and we'll work together to:
- **Build** - Turn concepts into working code
- **Run** - Execute and iterate quickly
- **Test** - Validate ideas and identify improvements

## Workspace Structure

```

├── blueprints/      # Complete app specifications (works without AI!)
├── ideas/           # Document and plan new ideas
├── prototypes/      # Quick experiments and proof-of-concepts
├── projects/        # More developed work
├── sandbox/         # Throw-away code for quick tests
└── docs/            # Notes, learnings, and documentation
```

## App Blueprints (Build Without AI)

Pre-built specifications for common app types. Use these when AI isn't available:

| Blueprint | What It Builds |
|-----------|----------------|
| [learning-app.md](blueprints/learning-app.md) | Book reader with notes, highlights, spaced repetition |
| [task-manager.md](blueprints/task-manager.md) | Todo/project management app |
| [dashboard.md](blueprints/dashboard.md) | Data visualization and analytics |
| [api-backend.md](blueprints/api-backend.md) | RESTful API with auth |
| [personal-website.md](blueprints/personal-website.md) | Portfolio site |
| [notes-app.md](blueprints/notes-app.md) | Note-taking application |

Each blueprint includes: features, data models, file structure, code snippets, and pitfalls to avoid.

See [GUIDE-building-without-ai.md](blueprints/GUIDE-building-without-ai.md) for how to work independently.

## Getting Started

1. **Share an idea** - Describe what you want to build or explore
2. **We plan together** - I'll help break it down into steps
3. **Build iteratively** - We code, run, and refine
4. **Learn and document** - Save what works for future reference

## Tips for Working with AI

- **Be specific** about what you want to achieve
- **Share context** about why you're interested in an idea
- **Ask questions** if something isn't clear
- **Iterate freely** - first versions don't need to be perfect

## Quick Commands

| What You Want | What to Say |
|--------------|-------------|
| Start a new idea | "Let's explore [your idea]" |
| Build something | "Help me create [description]" |
| Debug an issue | "This isn't working: [problem]" |
| Improve code | "How can we make this better?" |
| Learn a concept | "Explain how [topic] works" |
